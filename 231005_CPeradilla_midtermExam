'''
Write an algorithm, pseudocode, and code in Python to find the maximum element in a two-dimensional array. The array should 3 x 3 and student can provide their own given.


Instructions:
You are given a two-dimensional array, array, containing integer elements.

1. Write an algorithm to find the maximum element in the array.
2. Implement the algorithm in pseudocode.
3. Translate the pseudocode into Python code.
4. Test your code with the provided array.
5. Print the maximum element found in the array.
6. Ensure that your code is efficient and handles all possible edge cases.


Algortithm:

step 1: create a 3x3 2D array called "numbers" with consists of integers 
step 2: compare the elements one by one
step 3: if the current element is greater than the maximum element, update the maximum element with the current element
step 4: if the current element is less than the maximum element, keep the maximum element
step 5: repeat the process until it reaches the last element in the array

pseudocode:

define a function "finding_nemo (numbers)"
use for loop in comparing the elements 
if "maximum" (the current element) is greater than the "max_El", then "maximum" is stored in "max_El"
return "max_El" 

set ouput = function "finding_nemo (numbers)"
print "Maximum element found in the array is " + ouput
'''
def finding_nemo (numbers):
    max_El= numbers [0][0]
    
    for number in numbers:
        for element in number:
            if element > max_El:
                max_El = element
    return max_El
                

numbers = [
    
[ 10, 11, 12],
[ 20, 21, 22],
[ 30, 31, 32]
    
]

output = finding_nemo(numbers)
print ("Maximum element found in the array is", output)
